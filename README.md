# Java-FileMover-Program
A project to move files in a folder in Java by type and with various methods. It was a project I developed as a final project with my friends at university.

The project includes file encryption, file decryption, file zip, file hiding and file moving methods.

For example, you can encrypt ".txt" files in folder A by moving them to folder B.
